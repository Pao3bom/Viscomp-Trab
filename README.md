The notebook in this repository explores techniques of pre-processing and visualization to extract data intuitively from the following dataset: [NYC-Housing-Data-2003-2019](https://openml.org/search?type=data&id=43633&sort=runs&status=active)

In particular, the dataset contains records of all sales of housing in the city of New York from the years 2003 to 2019, containing specific information such as area, date of sale, price, address and such.

NOTE: This notebook is standalone. As long as you have the required libraries there's no need to download the dataset manually.
